# E-Shop an shopping app in Objective-C
This is a complete e-commerce app with different sections like Home, My-Cart, Account
1) Completely coded in Objective-C using UIKit framework.
2) I have parsed through json url for fetching the different products.
3) It has a functionality of sorting product on the basic of price and category. Also you can add a filter on price range. 
4) I have added a section called My-Cart in which we can add or remove any product.
5) This app also have a functionality of login and logout for purticular user. 
6) You can directly open any purticular section using deep links even if the app is not in background. 
7) This app also have accessibility support that means it can also be used by visually challenged people which will increase the reach of the app to more users.
